# Lab 11: Using Snyk to Find & Fix Vulnerabilities
## Introduction
Snyk is a developer-first security platform that helps identify and fix vulnerabilities in code, open-source dependencies, container images, and infrastructure as code (IaC). It enables developers to find and remediate security issues early in the development lifecycle, without slowing down the development process.

By integrating Snyk into the software development pipeline, teams can benefit from:

- **Automated vulnerability scanning** during coding, testing, and deployment.
- **Real-time feedback** on insecure dependencies or misconfigurations.
- **Fix recommendations and pull requests** that help resolve issues quickly.
- **Support for CI/CD integration**, enabling continuous security checks.
- **Detailed reporting and dashboards** for monitoring project health.

Using Snyk improves an organization’s security posture by shifting security left—addressing vulnerabilities earlier, where fixes are faster and less costly.
